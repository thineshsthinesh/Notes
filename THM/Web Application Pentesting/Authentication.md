# Enumeration & Brute Force 

## Authentication Enumeration 

Authentication enumeration involves observing how an application responds during authentication-related actions to identify valid usernames and understand underlying security behavior.

**Username Identification:**  
Different error messages during login or password reset (e.g., _"username doesn’t exist"_ vs _"incorrect password"_) reveal whether a username is valid. Registration pages that say _"username/email already taken"_ also confirm existing accounts.

**Password Policies:**  
Error messages that disclose password requirements (e.g., regex patterns requiring uppercase letters, digits, and symbols) allow attackers to craft dictionaries that match the enforced policy, making password guessing more effective.

**Common Enumeration Points:**

- **Registration pages:** Check if a username or email already exists.
- **Password reset pages:** Response differences confirm valid accounts.
- **Verbose error messages:** Reveal account validity.
- **Breached credential data:** Previously leaked usernames/passwords can be tested on other platforms.

Q: What type of error messages can unintentionally provide attackers with confirmation of valid usernames ? 
A: Verbose errors 

## Enumerating Users via Verbose Errors 


Verbose errors are detailed failure messages that reveal internal implementation details of an application (file paths, DB schema, user data). Useful for debugging but dangerous if exposed to attackers.

**What verbose errors can disclose:**

- **Internal paths:** server file paths and directory structure.
- **Database details:** table/column names or SQL error text.
- **User information:** hints about usernames or account state.
    

**How attackers induce verbose errors (common techniques):**

- **Invalid login attempts:** different error wording/timing that distinguishes valid vs invalid usernames.
- **SQL injection:** injecting SQL (e.g., a single quote) to force DB errors that reveal schema or queries.
- **File inclusion / path traversal:** payloads like `../../` to trigger path-related errors exposing internal locations.
- **Form manipulation:** tampering with fields (including hidden ones) to cause validation or logic errors that reveal backend expectations.
- **Application fuzzing:** automated, varied inputs (e.g., via Burp Intruder) to find inputs that provoke informative failures.

**Connection to enumeration & brute force:**

- Verbose errors help confirm valid usernames (enumeration).
- They reveal password-policy and lockout behavior details that make brute-force and credential-stuffing attacks more effective.

## Exploiting Vulnerable Password Rest Logic 

Password reset flows enable users to regain account access via channels (email, SMS, or security questions). Implementation must protect the secrecy and integrity of reset tokens and the identity-verification process.

**Common Methods:**

- **Email-based reset:** sends a link or token to the registered email; relies on email account security and token secrecy.
- **Security-question reset:** validates pre-configured answers; relies on secrecy of PII and answer strength.
- **SMS-based reset:** sends a code or link via SMS; relies on handset/SIM security and confidentiality of the message.
    

**Key Vulnerabilities:**

- **Predictable tokens:** sequential or guessable tokens enable attackers to generate valid reset links.
- **Token expiration issues:** long-lived or non-expiring tokens enlarge the attack window; tokens must be single-use and short-lived.
- **Insufficient validation:** weak security questions or compromised recovery channels allow unauthorized resets.
- **Information disclosure:** responses that reveal whether an email/username is registered aid enumeration.
- **Insecure transport:** delivering tokens over non-HTTPS or intercepted channels exposes reset secrets.

## Exploiting HTTP Basic Authentication 

Basic Authentication is a simple authentication mechanism where a client sends a username and password to the server using the HTTP `Authorization` header. The credentials are formatted as `username:password` and **base64 encoded**, not encrypted.

**Header Format:**

```
Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>
```

**Use Cases:**

- Still commonly used on **network devices** (e.g., routers, IoT devices) where resources are limited.
- Suitable for environments where **session management is unnecessary** and access is infrequent (e.g., configuration interfaces).

**Defined In:**

- **RFC 7617** — HTTP Basic Authentication specification.

**Security Considerations:**

- **Base64 ≠ Encryption** — credentials can be easily decoded.
- Must be used **only over HTTPS** to prevent interception.
- **Weak passwords** can be brute-forced.
- Provides **no session handling or additional security features** (unlike OAuth or token-based systems).

## OSINT 

**Wayback URLs (Internet Archive)**

- The Wayback Machine (archive.org/web) archives historical versions of sites.
- Inspecting archived pages can reveal files, directories or content removed from the live site but still accessible or referenced, which may expose sensitive remnants useful to an attacker.

**Google Dorks (targeted search queries)**

- Crafting targeted search queries (Google Dorks) uncovers information not intended to be public: admin panels, backup folders, logs, etc.
- Example queries from the provided text:
    
    - `site:example.com inurl:admin` — find administrative panels.
    - `filetype:log "password" site:example.com` — locate log files containing passwords.
    - `intitle:"index of" "backup" site:example.com` — discover backup directories or exposed indexes.

# Session Management 

## What is Session Management ? 

Web applications use sessions to maintain a user's identity across multiple requests because HTTP is stateless.

**Session Lifecycle:**

- **Session Creation:** A session is often created when visiting the site and is definitely established after login. The user receives a session ID which must be securely generated and stored.

- **Session Tracking:** The session ID is sent with each request so the server can identify the user and their permissions. Weak session tracking can lead to session hijacking or impersonation.
    
- **Session Expiry:** Sessions should expire after a set period of inactivity. Expired session IDs must no longer be accepted to prevent unauthorized reuse.
    
- **Session Termination:** When a user logs out, the session must be fully invalidated even if it has not expired. Incorrect termination can allow continued access.

Q: Which state in the session management lifecycle deals with user's pressing the logout button ?
A: Session Termination 

Q: Which state in the session management lifecycle deals with user's providing their credentials ?
A: Session Creation 

Q: Which state in the session management lifecycle deals with user's actions performed after authentication ? 
A: Session Tracking

Q: Which state in the session management lifecycle deals with user's that forget to log out of the application ? 
A: Session Expiry 

## IAAA Model 

The IAAA model explains the key concepts involved in secure user access:

- **Identification:** The user claims an identity, usually by providing a username.

- **Authentication:** The user proves the claimed identity, typically by supplying a correct password. Successful authentication leads to **session creation**.
    
- **Authorisation:** Determines what the authenticated user is allowed to do. During **session tracking**, the server checks the session to verify the user’s permissions for each action.
    
- **Accountability:** Actions performed by a user should be logged along with the session ID to trace activities during investigations or incidents.

In session management:

- Authentication ensures sessions are created securely.
    
- Authorization ensures the session holder has the correct permissions.
    
- Accountability ensures actions can be traced back to a session in case of misuse.

Q: What is the name of the process in the IAAA model that would be responsible for tracking your actions and logging them ? 
A: Accountability 

Q: What is the name of the process in the IAAA model that would be responsible for granting you a session value ? 
A: Authentication 

Q: What is the name of the process in the IAAA model that would be responsible for verifying that you have the relevant permissions to perform an action ? 
A: Authorization 

## Cookies vs Tokens 

Web applications typically manage sessions in one of two ways: **cookies** or **tokens**.

**Cookie-Based Session Management**

- The server sends a session ID via a `Set-Cookie` header (e.g., `Set-Cookie: session=12345;`).
    
- The browser stores and **automatically sends** the cookie with each request.
    
- Common cookie security attributes:
    
    - **Secure** – send only over HTTPS.
        
    - **HttpOnly** – prevents JavaScript from reading the cookie.
        
    - **Expire / Max-Age** – controls session lifetime.
        
    - **SameSite** – helps prevent CSRF.
        
- **Benefit:** Built-in browser handling and security features.
    
- **Drawback:** Cookies can be affected by CSRF since they are sent automatically.
    

**Token-Based Session Management**

- After login, the server sends a **token** (e.g., a JWT).
    
- The client stores it manually (often in LocalStorage).
    
- Client-side code adds the token to the **Authorization** header:
	```
	Authorization: Bearer <token>
	```
- **Benefit:** Not automatically sent → protects against CSRF and works well in distributed apps.
    
- **Drawback:** No automatic security protections; tokens must be carefully protected from exposure (e.g., XSS risk).

Q: What cookie attribute can be used to ensure that the cookie is only transmitted via secure HTTP channels ? 
A: secure 

Q: What HTTP header is used in the response to inform the browser that a cookie being sent ? 
A: Set-Cookie 

Q: What HTTP header is often used in requests to indicate the transmission of a JWT ? 
A: Authorization: Bearer
